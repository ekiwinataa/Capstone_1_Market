# Capstone 1 project - Python Application in running a market

HI! Hope you're doing well. Thank you for stoping by! This is my very first project along my journey learning **Data Science** with Purwadhika Digital Technology School. 

A bit of explaination, so this programme is about running a market bussiness:
  - When entering the programme, it will ask the user to define him/her self either as a Staff or Customer. To enter the staff mode, it requires access code before entering as a safety precaution while for customer mode, the user can freely enter and shop in the market.
  - In staff mode, it contains "CRUD" which are Create, Read, Update, and Delete features. Thus, the staff can "Read" all the stock available in the market, "Create" a new product details to be sold in the market, "Update" existing product details, and "Delete" unwanted product from the stock list.
  - In customer mode, it only contains "Read" feature with an additional feature which is "Shopping". The customer can view available products, add product to cart, checkout the product in cart, and of course pay the bills
  - The programme has been designed to avoid errors and crashes while in running. Moreover, the two modes (staff and customer) are integrated to one another in which anything that is done in customer mode will be integrated with the stock in staff mode and vice versa.


Kindly leave a comment or share your thought about my coding if you would so that I can keep developing my skills:)
